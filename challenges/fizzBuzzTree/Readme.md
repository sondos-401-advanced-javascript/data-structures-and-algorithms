# fizz-buzz-tree

## Challenge
Create a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a tree as an argument. determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:
If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.

## Approach & Efficiency
- I did the test by using this command `npm test`

## Big O
time is O(n) n depends on number of tree nodes. **Space**: O(h) h the heigh of tree.
