# fifo-animal-shelter


## Challenge
Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach. this class has two methods enqueue(animal) adds animal to the shelter. animal can be either a dog or a cat object. dequeue(pref) returns either a dog or a cat. If pref is not "dog" or "cat" then return null.

## Approach & Efficiency
- I did the test by using this command `npm test`

## Big O
time is O(n) for BinaryTree which n is number of node but the time for BinarySearchTree is O(log n). **Space**: O(h) for(BinaryTree and BinarySearchTree) which h is the high of tree.
