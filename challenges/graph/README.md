# Graph

## Challenge
create class called Graph, it has 5 methods. [AddNode] to Adds a new node to the graph. [AddEdge] Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph. [GetNodes] return all node in the graph as a collection. [GetNeighbors] Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node. [Size] return the total number of nodes in graph.

## Approach & Efficiency
- I did the test by using this command `npm test`

## Big O
time is O(1) for all the method in Graph class except [getNodes] the time O(n). **Space**: O(n) becuse it save in an Map.
