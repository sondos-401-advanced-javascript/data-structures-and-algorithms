# Linked List insertions


## Challenge
create new class extend from the LinkedList class, and add for this class three methods append, insertBefore and insertAfter. append for add to the end of linkedlist, insertBefore to add new node before exact value, insertAfter to add a new node after exact value. 

## Approach & Efficiency
- I used while loop and if statment.
- I did the test by using this command `npm test`

## Big O
time for the three methods append, insertBefore and insertAfter O(n) because all this method use while loop**Time**: worst case: if the size of linked list big. **Space**: append O(1) because you add one element to the memory at end,insertBefore O(1) you add one element before the exact value and insertAfter O(1) you add one element before the exact value.
